#### 1. Spreadsheet vs Database
- Table - equivalent to sheet
- Schema - collection of tables
- Database - collection for schema

Folder = Database
Workbook(excel file) = Schema
Sheet(excel tabs) = Table

#### 2. Schema
Under database we can create or drop schema.

#### 3. Worksheet
Worksheets is where we run our SQL queries, here is where we do our work for data warehousing.
- currently highlighted or where our cursor resides will be the SQL query that would run.
- query is separated by semi colon.
