#### Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
- You create it, you own it
- If specific role created some record, table and etc. it owns that resource/data, so it will be able to modify or delete it.
- It it tide to the role during creation.
- Other than RBAC this is used

#### Higher Roles have custodial oversight
this allows higher right to add, transfer or remove access from the child roles.
- **Custodial Right** - our ability to modify, delete and etc. to the roles with lower rights.
- **Custodial Oversight** - our decisions
**Account admin as sort of the parent of System admin.**
system admin can create its own database but since system admin is a child of account admin, account admin can take away the right to that database and give it to another.
Account admin can also delete resources owned by system admin and all of its child.
