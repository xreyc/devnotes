## CONNECTIVITY TO AWS

# VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- our owned virtual network in AWS
- allows you to define your private IP range for your AWS resources
- you can places things like EC2 instances ang ELB
- you have to place your resources into a different subnets

SUBNETS WITH NETWOKING RULES
  - are chunks of IP addresses that allow you to group resources
  - it can be one or more EC2 intance
  - control whether resources are public or private

# YOU CAN CONTROL WHAT TRAFFIC GETS INTO YOUR VPC
- you might have internet facing resources that the public should be able to reach
like a public website.
- you have resources that are only reachable if the user is logged in into your
private network. These could be internal services like an HR application or a
backend database

# PUBLIC FACING RESOURCES
- you have to attach Internet Gateway (IGW) to your VPC
- Internet gateway is like a doorway that is open to the public
- Without internet gateway no one can reach your resources

# IGW
- a doorway that is open to the public

# PRIVATE FACING RESOURCES
- allows only traffic that came from an approve network
- we use Private Gateway/Doorway on this case
- Virtual Private Gateway = Private Gateway/Doorway
  - it allows you to create a VPN that allows you yo create a connection
  to private network like your on premise network

# PROBLEM
  - the secret network route still uses the public routes.
  - this may be susceptible to slowdowns or traffic jams.
  - it uses the same road used by the rest of the world.
  - they are encrypted but still uses a regular internet connection

# SOLUTION: AWS DIRECT CONNECT
- using a direct doorway which no one use
- you can use a private doorway with low latency
DIRECT CONNECT
  - allows you to establish a private dedicated fiber connection from your data
  center to AWS
  - you have to look for a direct connect to your area to establish the connection
  - AWS provides a physical line
