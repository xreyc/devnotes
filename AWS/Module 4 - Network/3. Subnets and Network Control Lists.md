## SUBNETS AND NETWORK CONTROL LISTS

# OTHER PARTS OF VPC
- network hardening
- application security
- user identity
- authentication and authorization
- distributed denial of service prevention
- data integrity
- encryption

## NETWORK HARDENING
- public subnets has access to the internet gateways
- private subnets do not
- subnets can control traffic permission

PACKETS - are message from the internet
- every packet the cross the subnet boundaries gets check by the Network access
control list

## NETWORK ACCESS CONTROL LIST (NETWORK ACL) - SUBNET LEVEL
- checks the packets that enter or leave the subnet based on where it come from
- it acts like passport control officer
PROBLEM
- it can't answer all the network access control because it only evaluate a packet
when it crosses the subnet boundaries
- it can't check if a packet enters a specific EC2 instance

## SECURITY GROUP - EC2 LEVEL
- you can modify it to accept specific type of request only
- you can allow specific traffic only
- validate only incoming traffics
- it works like a doorman of the building (EC2) but won't bother the list of the
way out

## SECURITY GROUP VS NETWORK ACL
# NETWORK ACL
- Stateless (it remembers nothing, it check every single traffic that goes in
or out)
# SECURITY GROUP
- Stateful (it has some kind of memory on who to allow in or out)
- it can recognize the packets from before, so it automatically allows a traffic in


## WORKFLOW (EC2 A, SUBNET B) AND (EC2 B, SUBNET B)
1 EC2 A makes a request into the EC2 B
2 EC2 A security group allows all outbound traffic to go out
3 SUBNET A validates the packet if it can go out
4 SUBNET B validates the packet if it can go in
5 EC2 B security group validates if the traffic can go in
6 EC2 B allows outbound traffic to go out
7 SUBNET B validates if the outbound traffic can go out
8 SUBNET A validates if the outbound traffic can go in
9 EC2 A remembers the packet so it just allows the traffic to go in
