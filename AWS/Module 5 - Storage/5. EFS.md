## Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)

- is a manage file system
- shared file systems across the application

Example:
- you have multiple servers running on a Linux on large amount of data being stored
on a large file system
- on on-premise server you have to make sure your storage can keep up with the data
your store and keep all the back

# EFS
- AWS handles all the scaling and the replication
- allows you to have multiple instances can access the data in EFS at the same time
- it can scale up and down when you need it without you doing it

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EFS AND EBS
# EBS (ACTS LIKE A HARD DRIVE)
- volumes attach to EC2 instance
- only on a single availability zone resource
- to attach EC2 to EBS, you need to be in the same available zone to attach EC2
instances
- it do not automatically scale

# EFS (REGIONAL)
- can have multiple instances reading and writing simultaneously
- it is not just a hard drive it is true Linux file system
- regional resource, any EC2 instance in a region can write to the EFS file system
- since its regional, is stores data across multiple availability zone
- automatically scales
- the duplicate storage enables you to access data concurrently from all the
Availability Zones in the Region where a file system is located
- on-premises servers can access Amazon EFS using AWS Direct Connect.
