## AWS DATA MIGRATION SERVICE (AWS DMS)

- helps you migrate data from on-premise database on a secure ang easy fashion.
- you can easily migrate data from the source ang target database
- the source database remains fully operational during the migration
- minimize downtime for applications that rely on the database
- the source and the target databases don't have to be of the same type

# HOMOGENOUS DATABASES
- source and target database are the same type
- from MySQL to Amazon RDS for MySQL
- from Microsoft SQL Server to Amazon RDS for SQL Server
- from Oracle to Amazon RDS for Oracle
* Process is straightforward
  - Schema Structures
  - Data Types
  - Database Code
  are compatible between source and target

** You can create migration process using DMS that has a connection to the source
and the target

# HETEROGENEOUS DATABASES
- source and target database are different type
- data type, schema and database code are different
* it is a two step process
  1. Convert using AWS Schema conversion
  - it converts Schema and code to match on the target database
  2. Use DMS to migrate data from the source to the target

# OTHER USE CASES OF DMS
- development and test database migration
  (used for migrating production data into test without affecting production users)
  (you can use DMS to make a copy of the production into dev and test environments)
- database consolidation
  (from multiple databases into one database)
- continuous database replication
  (replicate data into multiple database for disaster recovery)
