## INSTANCES STORES AND AMAZON BLOCK STORE (Amazon EBS)
- EC2 uses CPU, Memory, Network and Storage

## STORAGE
- when EC2 instance run, it runs on block level storage
- it is a place to store files, a series of bytes that are stored in blocks on disk.
- when file is updating the whole series of files aren't all updated, it just updates
the pieces that are changed.
- a laptop is a block level storage (hard drive)
- EC2 instance runs on a hard drive itself

THIS IS AN EFFICIENT STORAGE TYPE FOR
- Databases
- Enterprise Software
- File Systems

## INSTANCE STORE VOLUME (TEMPORARY STORAGE)
- when you launch an EC2 instance, it will provide you with a local storage called
instance store volumes dependent on the storage type.
- this volume are physically attached to the host, you can write to it like a normal
hard drive
- this is tied directly to the host
- if you stop or terminate an EC2 instance, all data on the instance store volume will
be deleted
- good for temporary files or files that can be easily recreated
- DO NOT WRITE IMPORTANT FILES INSIDE INTANCE STORE VOLUME

SOLUTION:
## AMAZON ELASTIC BLOCK STORE (EBS)
- we can create virtual hard drives called EBS volumes that can be attached to
EC2 instance.
- this is separate drives from the instance store volumes
- this is not tied directly to the host
- data the stored on EBS persist even EC2 instance are terminated

EBS CAN BE CONFIGURED BEFORE ATTACHING TO EC2 INSTANCE
- size
- type
- configuration

EBS USE CASE:
- to have a hard drive that persist files that our application wrote.
- EBS creates incremental data backup (Snapshots)

INCREMENTAL BACKUP IS DIFFERENT FROM FULL BACKUP
- incremental backup only data that are updated/changed or new
