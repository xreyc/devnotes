SCENARIOS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Complex analysis of data spread across multiple tables
- you have a sales supply chain system that you have to analyze for week spot
# USE RDS
- it is built for business analytics
- you can use complex relational joins

2. All other use case
- you have employee contact with name, phone number, email and etc., these are
sing table territory. We can use relational database on this but it works best on
non relational.
# USE DynamoDB
- it is incredibly fast
- you don't need complex join function
