## Monolithic Applications
Applications are made of multiple components. The components communicate
with each other to transmit data, fulfill requests, and keep the application
running.

Suppose that you have an application with tightly coupled components. These
components might include databases, servers, the user interface, business
logic, and so on. This type of architecture can be considered a monolithic
application.

In this approach to application architecture, if a single component fails,
other components fail, and possibly the entire application fails

## Microservices
To help maintain application availability when a single component fails, you can
design your application through a microservices approach.

In a microservices approach, application components are loosely coupled. In this
case, if a single component fails, the other components continue to work because
they are communicating with each other. The loose coupling prevents the entire
application from failing.

When designing applications on AWS, you can take a microservices approach with
services and components that fulfill different functions. Two services facilitate
application integration: Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) and
Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS).
