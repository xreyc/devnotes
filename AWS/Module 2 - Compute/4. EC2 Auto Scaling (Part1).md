## SCALABILITY AND ELASTICITY

## SCALE UP - Adding more machines
# We need more instances instead of one big instance.
  - more instance can entertain more processes while one big instance
  processes many processes on its own.

## SCALE IN/OUT - Removing instances
# All instances that are not utilized are remove

## AUTO SCALING GROUP
* MINIMUM CAPACITY
- you can set the minimum number of Amazon EC2 instances
- minimum capacity is the number of Amazon EC2 instances that launch immediately
after you have created the Auto Scaling group
* DESIRED CAPACITY
- you can set the desired capacity at two Amazon EC2 instances even though your
application needs a minimum of a single Amazon EC2 instance to run.
* MAXIMUM CAPACITY
- you can set the maximum number of instances you system to scale up to.

NOTE: If you do not specify the desired number of Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto
Scaling group, the desired capacity defaults to your minimum capacity.
