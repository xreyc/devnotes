## SCALABILITY AND ELASTICITY
- can grow or shrink

COMMON PROBLEMS
* if we talk about utilization, there are two scenarios.
- using EC2 instance with average computing capacity but unable to deliver user need
at peak times when users used the system.
- using EC2 instance with high capacity and can deliver the everything to the user
but the problem is that most of the time the server is not utilize and use only around
10% capacity.

SOLUTION: AMAZON AUTO SCALING
- If we add another instance that also process thing, when the other instance can't deliver
the other will take the processes.
- The task is divided, the main EC2 will take most of the load while the other one is free.
- The amazon auto scaling, turns off EC2 instances that are unused.


## Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling enables you to automatically add or remove Amazon EC2 instances
in response to changing application demand. By automatically scaling your instances in
and out as needed, you are able to maintain a greater sense of application availability.

Within Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, you can use two approaches: dynamic scaling and predictive scaling.
- Dynamic scaling responds to changing demand.
- Predictive scaling automatically schedules the right number of Amazon EC2 instances based on predicted demand.
