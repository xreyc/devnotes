## DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACTS

# DISTRIBUTED DENIAL-OF-SERVICE (DDoS)
- an attack of your enterprise infrastructure
- shutdown the application ability to function by overwhelming the system
to the point it can no longer operate
- in a normal application the user sends request and receive response
- the hacker tries to overwhelm the capacity of your application, to deny
anyone to your services
- the attacker uses many machines around the internet to unknowingly attack
your infrastructure
- the attacker commands many machines to attack the victim to process so many
data to process to a point it cannot process data.

## UDP FLOOD ATTACK
- providing request to an specific server (other server) and providing a wrong
address (victim)
- anyone can send request to the server (other server) and the response has many
values which will go to the victim server.

USER ----> (OTHER SERVER) ---------------------> (VICTIM SERVER)
           (WEATHER API)                  (Will receive a lot of request)
   (receives wrong address (victim))     (the one will receive the response)

THE VICTIM SERVER
- will check all the information it never wanted to receive at the first place
- this is low level brute force attack

# SOLUTION FOR UDP: Security Groupo
# Security Groups
  - only allows proper request traffic
  - weather report uses an entirely different protocol than the one your users used
  - works at the AWS network level
- it will be hard for the attacker to attack AWS services vs the size of the AWS
- it is possible, but it will be costly fot the user

## HTTP LEVEL ATTACKS
- the server will receive a lot of request from a lot machines requesting data
or sending data over and over again

##  SLOWLIRIC ATTACK
- instead of a normal transaction
- the user pretends to have a very slow internet connection
- other user will wait for that user to finish his/her request
- until the current customer is not done, the next packet of request will not be
process

# SOLUTION: ELB
# ELASTIC LOAD BALANCER
- the request will be distributed, will no longer wait for the slow request
- to overwhelm ELB, you have to overwhelm the entire AWS regions

#### AWS SHIELD WITH AWS WAF
- uses a web application firewall, to filter incoming traffic with the signature
of the bad actors.
- it has extensive machine learning capabilities
