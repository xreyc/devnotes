## HOW TO INTERACT WITH AWS SERVICES
* API - Application Programming Interface
  - you can use this to Provision, Configure and Manage your AWS Resources
  # Each of this is a different request to AWS via API
  - you can launch EC2 Instance
  - you can create AWS Lamda Function

# INTERACTING WITH AWS SERVICES
- AWS Management Console
- AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
- AWS Software Development Kit (SDKs)
- Various Other Tools like AWS Clound Formation

# AWS Management Console
- is browser based
- you can manage your AWS resources visually
- useful for building test environments
- view AWS bills
- view monitoring
- work with non-technical resources
- good only for test but not on production, because you have to do a lot of
checkbox or buttons.

# AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
- good for production
- allows you to make API calls using the terminal on your machine
- makes actions scriptable and repeatable
- makes the whole process more faster
- less susceptible to human error
- you can run scripts automatically using a scheduler or run by a process

# AWS Software Development Kit (SDK)
- you can interact with AWS resources through various programming languages

## OTHER WAYS TO MANAGE AWS RESOURCES
* AWS Elastic Beanstalk
  - A service that helps you provision EC2 based environments
  - you can provide your application code and desired configurations
  - after talking the application code, it will automatically build the environment
  - can be used to save environment configurations then can be used to deploy again
  with ease.
  - helps you focus on your business application, not the infrastructure
* AWS Cloud Formation
  - infrastructure as code tool used to define a wide variety of AWS resources in
  a declarative way using JSON or YAML text based document called Cloud formation
  template.
  - not only limited on EC2
  ALSO AVAILABLE ON
  - Storage
  - Database
  - Analytics
  - Machine Learning
  - once you defined your cloud formation template, cloud formation will parse the
  template then begin provisioning your resources you defined in parallel.
  - it manages all the AWS API call.
  - you can run the same cloud formation template on multiple accounts or multiple
  regions to create identical environments across.
