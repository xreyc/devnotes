Mixins are a way of reusing the code in multiple classes. Mixins are declared using the keyword **mixin** followed by the mixin name. Three keywords are used while working with mixins: **mixin**, **with**, and **on**. It is possible to use multiple mixins in a class.

#### Rules for mixin
- **Mixin** can’t be instantiated. You can’t create object of mixin.
- Use the **mixin** to share the code between multiple classes.
- **Mixin** has no constructor and cannot be extended.
- It is possible to use multiple **mixins** in a class.

Syntax:
```dart
mixin Mixin1{
  // code
}

mixin Mixin2{
  // code
}

class ClassName with Mixin1, Mixin2{
  // code
}
```

**Example 1:**
```dart
mixin ElectricVariant {
  void electricVariant() {
    print('This is an electric variant');
  }
}

mixin PetrolVariant {
  void petrolVariant() {
    print('This is a petrol variant');
  }
}
// with is used to apply the mixin to the class
class Car with ElectricVariant, PetrolVariant {
  // here we have access of electricVariant() and petrolVariant() methods
}

void main() {
  var car = Car();
  car.electricVariant();
  car.petrolVariant();
}
```

**Example 2:**
```dart
mixin CanFly {
  void fly() {
    print('I can fly');
  }
}

mixin CanWalk {
  void walk() {
    print('I can walk');
  }
}

class Bird with CanFly, CanWalk {
 
}

class Human with CanWalk {
 
}

void main() {
  var bird = Bird();
  bird.fly();
  bird.walk();

  var human = Human();
  human.walk();
}
```
