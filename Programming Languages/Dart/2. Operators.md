#### 1. Types of operators
- Arithmetic operators
- Increment and decrement operators
- Assignment operators
- Relational operators
- Logical operators
- Type test operators
#### 2. Arithmetic operators

| Symbol | Name             |
| ------ | ---------------- |
| +      | addtions         |
| -      | subtraction      |
| -expr  | unary minus      |
| *      | multiplication   |
| /      | division         |
| ~/     | integer division |
| %      | modulus          |
**Example:**
```dart
int num1=10;
int num2=3;

int sum=num1+num2;       // addition 13
int diff=num1-num2;      // subtraction 7
int unaryMinus = -num1;    // unary minus -10
int mul=num1*num2;       // multiplication 30
double div=num1/num2;    // division 3.3333333333333335
int div2 =num1~/num2;     // integer division 3
int mod=num1%num2;       // show remainder 1
```
#### 3. Increment and decrement operators

| Symbol | name           | description                                                      |
| ------ | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ++var  | pre increment  | Increase Value By 1. var = var + 1 **Expression value is var+1** |
| --var  | pre decrement  | Decrease Value By 1. var = var - 1 **Expression value is var-1** |
| var++  | post increment | Increase Value By 1. var = var + 1 **Expression value is var**   |
| var--  | post decrement | Decrease Value By 1. var = var - 1 **Expression value is var**   |
```dart
// declaring two numbers 
 int num1=0;
 int num2=0;

// pre increment   
num2 = ++num1;
print("The value of num2 is $num2"); // The value of num2 is 1
num2 = ++num1;
print("The value of num2 is $num2"); // The value of num2 is 2

// reset value to 0 
num1 = 0;
num2 = 0;

// post increment  
num2 =  num1++;
print("The value of num2 is $num2"); // The value of num2 is 0
num2 =  num1++;
print("The value of num2 is $num2"); // The value of num2 is 1
```
#### 4. Assignment operators

| type | description                  |
| ---- | ---------------------------- |
| =    | assign a value to a variable |
| +=   | adds a value to a variable   |
| -=   | reduce a value to a variable |
| *=   | multiply value to a variable |
| /=   | divided value by a variable  |
```dart
double age = 24;
age+= 1;  // Here age+=1 means age = age + 1.
print("After Addition Age is $age");
age-= 1;  //Here age-=1 means age = age - 1.
print("After Subtraction Age is $age");
age*= 2;  //Here age*=2 means age = age * 2.
print("After Multiplication Age is $age");
age/= 2;  //Here age/=2 means age = age / 2.
print("After Division Age is $age");
```
#### 5. Relational operators
| Operator Symbol | Operator Name            | Description                                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `>`             | Greater than             | Used to check which operand is bigger and gives result as boolean             |
| `<`             | Less than                | Used to check which operand is smaller and gives result as boolean            |
| `>=`            | Greater than or equal to | Used to check which operand is bigger or equal and gives result as boolean    |
| `<=`            | Less than or equal to    | Used to check which operand is smaller or equal and gives result as boolean   |
| `==`            | Equal to                 | Used to check operands are equal to each other and gives result as boolean    |
| `!=`            | Not equal to             | Used to check operand are not equal to each other and gives result as boolean |
#### 6. Logical operators
|Operator Type|Description|
|---|---|
|`&&`|This is ‘and’, return true if all conditions are true|
|`\|`|This is ‘or’. Return true if one of the conditions is true|
|`!`|This is ’not’. return false if the result is true and vice versa|
#### 7. Type test operators
| Operator Symbol | Operator Name | Description                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `is`            | is            | Gives boolean value true if the object has a specific type  |
| `is!`           | is not        | Gives boolean value false if the object has a specific type |
