### 1. Create a CodeCommit
Create a repository for our application.
- Go to CodeCommit then click *Create repository*
- Open your repository click *Clone URL* (this will copy the url)
- On your local machine, run *git clone pastetheurlhere*
- Enter your CodeCommit credentials (Check on documentation if you don't have one)
- On the root folder of your flutter project, run
- ![[Pasted image 20240619204519.png]]
```c
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git push
```
Create 3 branches that will be used for our environments (dev, test, prod), run the following commands:
```c
// Create a dev branch
git checkout -b "dev"
git push

// Create a test branch
git checkout master // go back to master branch
git checkout -b "test"
git push

// Create a production branch
git checkout master
git checkout -b "prod"
git push
git checkout master
```
these branches will be used on our CodePipeline for different type of environment.
### 2. Create an S3 bucket
this is where we are going to host our application.
- Go to S3 then click *Create a bucket*
- Add your S3 bucket name ex: *flutter-test-s3*
- Uncheck *Block all public access*
- Disable *Bucket Versioning*
- Click *Create Bucket*
- Open your bucket name created
- Go to *properties*
- Go to *Static website hosting* then click Edit then set these settings. (You can change these settings if you want to add attach a domain name)
	- **Static website**: Enabled
	- **Hosting type**: Host a static website
	- **Index document**: index.html
	- **Redirection rules:** (leave empty for now)
	- **Save changes**
- Go to *Permissions* then edit *Bucket policy*
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::yourbucketname/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### 3. Create a CodeBuild
This will perform the build command of our application. (this will perform the build command we can do locally). To verify that build doesn't fail, run "flutter build web" on your local machine to make sure that the build command will also run successful on CI/CD pipeline.

- Go to CodeBuild then click "Create project"
- Set your project name ex: *flutter-test-s3-codebuild*
- On source set to *AWS CodeCommit*
	- Select repository we previously created
	- Select specific branch where this code build pulls its source code. (make sure that codecommit repository have 4 primary branched **master, dev, test, prod**)
	- if you are building a CodeBuild for development environment, use dev branch. (Note: You have to create one CodeBuild for each environment)
- Environment settings
	- **Provisioning model:** On Demand
	- **Environment image:** Managed image
	- **Compute:** EC2
	- **Operating System:** Ubuntu
	- **Runtime:** Standard
	- **Image:** aws/codebuild/standard:7.0
	- **Image version:** Always use the latest image for this runtime version
	- **Service role:** (you can create new or use existing one(manually created))
- Buildspec set to *Use a buildspec file*
		- Buildspec name: buildspec.yml
- Artifacts set to *No Artifact*
- Leave everything default then click *Create build project*

### 4. Create a CodePipeline

Code pipeline is like the orchestrator of the CI/CD. It observes if there changes on specific branch so that it can create a deployment state, then it triggers the CodeBuild to run a build for deployment. After successful build, it then commands the CodeDeploy to deploy the Artifacts created from the CodeBuild to specific server/environment ex: S3, ECS, EC2 and etc.

- Go to CodePipeline then click *Create new*
- Set pipeline name ex: *flutter-test-s3-codepipeline*
- It will automatically create a service role or (you can use existing one)
- Add Source Stage
	- Select *AWS CodeCommit*
	- Select Repository Name
	- Select Branch (select specific branch dev, test, prod) (Note: Each CodePipeline have to represent specific environment)
	- Leave everything default

### 5. Create a build spec
On the root folder of your flutter project, create a file named *buildspec.yml*
- Copy this script into your buildspec.yml
```yml
version: 0.2
phases:
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - echo Pre Build started on `date`
      - git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable
      - export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"
      - flutter packages pub get
      - flutter config --enable-web
  build:
    commands:
      - echo Build started on `date`
      - flutter build web --release
  post_build:
    commands:
      - echo Build completed on `date`
artifacts:
  files:
    - "**/*"
  discard-paths: no
  base-directory: "build/web"
```
- Create a deployment
```
git add .
git commit -m "deployment"
git push
```
