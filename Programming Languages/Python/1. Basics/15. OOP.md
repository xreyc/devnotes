#### 1. Class
```
class className:
	classAttribute
```

**# Simple class:**
this is a simplest form of a class, this are not really useful in real life applications
```
class Character:
	name = "Mark"
	hp = 100
	mp = 50
	atk = 12
	lvl = 1
```

**# Accessing object property**
```
charOne = Character()
charOne.name
```

**# Modify object properties**
initializing this way, is too long. Check the next example for constructor for better approach.
```
charOne.name = "New value"
charOne.hp = 120
charOne.mp = 20
charOne.atk = 22
charOne.lvl = 2
```

**# Delete object property**
```
del charOne.name
```

**# __init__ function**
all classes have function  called `__init__()`, which is always executed when the class is being initiated.
```
class Person:
	def __init__(self, name, age):
		self.name = name
		self.age = age

p1 = Person("John", 30)
print(p1.name)
```

**# __str__ function**
- controls what should be returned when the class object is represented as a string.
- if `__str__` function is not set, the string representation of the object is returned

Without str:
```
class Person:
	def __init__(self, name, age):
		self.name = name
		self.age = age

p1 = Person("John", 36)
print(p1) #__main__.Person object at 0x15039e602100>
```

With str:
```
class Person:
	def __init__(self, name, age):
		self.name = name
		self.age = age
	def __str__(self):
		return f"{self.name}({self.age})"

p1 = Person("John", 36)
print(p1) #John(36)
```
#### 2. Constructor
- Used to initialize an object or simply put values on its attributes when it is created.
- The given example above have a default attributes, it means we to explicitly set the values after its initialization, ex" **charOne.name** it would result to a longer code.
- With constructor we can set new value during the initialization stage.

**# Initialize Function**
this runs on class initialization.
```
class className:
	def __init__(self):
		#initializecode
		instanceAttribute
```

**self**
- in the parameter of init is pertaining to itself the object that being created.
- it points to the created instance, it property and etc..
- equivalent to this of JavaScript.
- it is always the first parameter of the function, it can be x or other name, everything inside a class function receives self as a parameter.
```
class Character:
	def __init__(self, name, hp, mp, atk, lvl):
		self.name = name
		self.hp = hp
		self.mp = atk
		self.lvl = lvl
		print(name + "created")
# create an instance
charOne = Character("David", 10, 10, 10, 10);
```

**# Difference between class attribute and instance attribute**
- **Class attribute**
	- this are defined directly within the class body but outside of any method.
	- are shared among all instances of the class.
	- accessed using the class name (same to static)
	- can be modified using the class name directly.
	- initialized outside of any instance methods.
- **Instance attribute**
	- defined within instance method using self.
	- each instance can have their own value.
	- initialized within the init method or other instance method.

#### 3. Object Methods

```
class className:
	def __init__(self):
		#initilizecode
	def objFunc(self):
		#dosomething
```

**Example:**
```
class Animal:
	def __init__(self, type, voice):
		self.type = type
		self.voice = voice
	def speak(self):
		print(self.voice)
```

#### 3. Inheritance

**pass**
- this will inherit all the attributes of the parent so that we will be able to access all the same functionality on the child class
- use this when you do not want to add any other properties or method to the class

`__init__`
- this is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new project.

**Parent class**
```
class parentClassName:
	def __init__(self):
		#initializeCode
	def objFunc(self):
		#dosomething
```

**Child class**
```
class childClassName(parentClassName):
	pass
```

**# Example**

**Parent class:**
```
class Person:
	def __init__(self, firstName, lastName):
		self.firstName = firstName
		self.lastName = lastName
	def introduce(self):
		print("Hi I am " + self.firstName)
```

**Child class:**
```
class Student(Person):
	pass

pOne = Person("David", "Parker")
pOne.introduce() # Hi I am David

pTwo = Student("David", "Parker")
pTwo.introduce() # Hi I am David
```

#### 4. Overriding constructor

**super()**
- can only be used by a child class
- pertains to its parent using that function, we can access every function in our parent  class inside our child class

**Child class:**
```
class childClassName(parentClassName):
	def __init__(self, attributes):
		super():__init__(attributes)
		# add attributes
```
**def init(self, attributes):** - this belongs to the child class
**super():init(attributes)** - this runs the constructor of our parent class.
we can also add attributes since we are inside the init function.

**# Example**

**Parent class**
```
class Person:
	def __init__(self, firstName, lastName):
		self.firstName = firstName
		self.lastName = lastName
	def introduce(self):
		print("Hi I am " + self.firstName)
```

**Child class**
```
class Student(Person):
	def __init__(self, firstName, lastName, year): #this belongs to the child
		super().__init__(firstname, lastName) #this belongs to the parent
		self.year = year # this belongs to the child
	def introduce(self):
		print("Hi am am " + self.firstNamem + " from child")
```

**Customizing Overrode Functions**
- here we are adding additional functional functionality to an existing parent function.
- from the looks of it, we are just running the parent function inside our child function.
```
class Student(Person):
	def __init__(self, firstName, lastName, year): #this belongs to the child
		super().__init__(firstname, lastName) #this belongs to the parent
		self.year = year # this belongs to the child
	def introduce(self):
		print("This is from child1")
		super().introduce()
		print("This is from child2")
```
	
**# Difference between pass and super()**
**super()** - is used to access methods and attributes of a superclass from within a subclass, allowing for method overriding and extension of inherited behavior. 
**pass** - is used as a placeholder when a statement is syntactically required but no action is needed. It is often used to define empty classes, functions, or loops that will be implemented later.
